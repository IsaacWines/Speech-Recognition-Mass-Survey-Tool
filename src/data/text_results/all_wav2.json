say im not taking any chances you are just what the doc ordered im beginnin to feel like a rap god rap god all my people from the front to the back nod back nod now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box they said i rap like a robot so call me rapbot but for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes i got a laptop in my back pocket my penll go off when i halfcock it got a fat knot from that rap profit made a livin and a killin off it ever since bill clinton was still in office with monica lewinsky feelin on his nutsack im an mc still as honest but as rude and as indecent as all hell syllables skillaholic kill em all with this flippity dippityhippity hiphop you dont really wanna get into a pissin match with this rappity brat packin a mac in the back of the ac backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while im practicin that ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact how could i not blow all i do is drop fbombs feel my wrath of attack rappers are havin a rough time period heres a maxi pad its actually disastrously bad for the wack while im masterfully constructing this masterpi\u00e8ce you might also like cause im beginnin to feel like a rap god rap god all my people from the front to the back nod back nod now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box let me show you maintainin this shit aint that hard that hard everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like \u03b9 have got well to be truthful the blueprints simply rage and youthful exuberance everybody loves to root for a nuisance hit the earth like an asteroid did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew mcs get taken to school with this music cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme now i lead a new school full of students me im a product of rakim lakim shabazz pac nwa cube hey doc ren yella eazy thank you they got slim inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position to meet run\u2013dmc and induct them into the motherfuckin rock and roll hall of fame even though ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames only hall of fame ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame on the wall of shame you fags think its all a game til i walk a flock of flames off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin little gaylookin boy so gay i can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy haha youre witnessin a massoccur like youre watching a church gathering take place lookin boy oy vey that boys gay\u2014thats all they say lookin boy you get a thumbs up pat on the back and a way to go from your label every day lookin boy hey lookin boy what you say lookin boy i get a hell yeah from dre lookin boy ima work for everything i have never asked nobody for shit get outta my face lookin boy basically boy youre never gonna be capable of keepin up with the same pace lookin boy cause\u2014 im beginnin to feel like a rap god rap god all my people from the front to the back nod back nod the way im racin around the track call me nascar nascar dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god kneel before general zod this planets krypton\u2014no asgard asgard so youll be thor and ill be odin you rodent im omnipotent let off then im reloadin immediately with these bombs im totin and i should not be woken im the walkin dead but im just a talkin head a zombie floatin but i got your mom deepthroatin im out my ramen noodle we have nothin in common poodle im a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil its me my honestys brutal but its honestly futile if i dont utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like im on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin to censor you like that one line i said on im back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say ill take seven kids from columbine put em all in a line add an ak a revolver and a  see if i get away with it now that i aint as big as i was but im morphin into an immortal comin through the portal youre stuck in a time warp from  though and i dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for youre pointless as rapunzel with fuckin cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweathers pad singin to a man while he played piano man oh man that was a  special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day hey fab ima kill you lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed jj fad uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin im a human what i gotta do to get it through to you im superhuman innovative and im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and itll glue to you and im devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off theyll be celebrating cause i know the way to get em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh hes too mainstream well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it its not hiphop its pop\u2014cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make em lose it i dont know how to make songs like that i dont know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while im rippin any one of these verses that versus you its curtains im inadvertently hurtin you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to and im a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but its still tongueincheek fuck you im drunk so satan take the fucking wheel ima sleep in the front seat bumpin heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head theres something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it lifes handin you lemons make lemonade then but if i cant batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake em a cake then dont mistake him for satan its a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and dont be a retard\u2014be a king think not why be a king when you can be a godk",
